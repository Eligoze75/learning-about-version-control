# Learning about Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

## What I like the most about version control

I think that the most useful feature of version control is the ability to track changes over time and have a secure backup of my work. Also, the ability to collaborate with others without overwriting each other's changes is very valuable.

I also think that the ability to share a project with others easily is very important.

## What I don't like about version control

Omg, conflicts are the worst! I hate having to resolve conflicts, especially when they are complex and involve multiple files. It can be very time consuming and frustrating.
